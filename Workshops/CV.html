        <p>Op deze pagina zijn de opdrachten te vinden welke passend zijn bij de lesstof welke tijdens de workshop Computer Vision zijn behandeld</p>

        <h2>Assignments</h2>
        <h4>Portfolio Assignment 3. Add Color</h4>
        <p>Add a colour to the sketch you made in the Getting Started Assignment.
        Make a screenshot or recording of the result of your sketch and add this to your portfolio.</br>

        <h4>Portfolio Assignment 7. Computer Vision</h4>
        <p>Experiment/tinker with some of the examples linked above. 
            Try to change some of the code to make it do something else. 
            Make a screenshot or recording of the result of your sketch and add this to your portfolio.</p>

        <h4>Portfolio Assignment 8. Hand position and distance</h4>
        <p>Experiment with these wrist keypoints and/or calculating the distance between wrist keypoints. 
            Visualize this in an interesting way in the sketch. For example, draw a box on the screen that 
            fits perfectly between your hands. Or detect when someone is extending their arms like flying an airplane.</p>

        <h4>Portfolio Assignment 9. Cheer Detection</h4>
        <p>After familiarizing yourself with detecting the keypoints, here is an exercise with a very specific goal. 
            Make a sketch that detect if someone is cheering by analysing the position of their hands. 
            When cheering is detected visualise that in an interesting way.</p>
